# Project - Score hospitals by the billing behavior
Every year the US government loses an estimated $68 billion dollars, three percent of healthcare annual spending, due to claim abuse, corruption, and fraud. Others estimate such misused bills could even reach as high as ~10% of the annual expenditure. The hidden, inappropriate claims are hard to identify, and yet could lead the healthcare system impaired and weakened. In fact, a large number of providers (>39%) are believed to manipulate reimbursement rules in a way that make the claims appear necessary to the insurance companies and the patients. It is urgent to identify a list of providers who frequently bill higher, unreasonably, and abusively. To distinguish the opportunistic providers from the providers that are billing with quality service, a score that compensates for a high charge will be given to each provider. The resulting score system will be a valuable reference for insurance companies when processing the claims, and for the patients before visits.
To validate that the project is feasible, I used the data from [Kaggle CMS Medicare database](https://www.kaggle.com/cms/cms-medicare) that covers the US nationwide Medicare bills from 3770 providers during the years of 2011-2015, to perform the following two assets. [The first asset](https://github.com/HannahhoHe/Medicare---Insight-into-the-Bills/blob/master/README.md) is to verify that the medical charges vary greatly by the providers â€“ some providers tend to bill higher than their peers irrespective of the type of service (see 1st asset: Do some providers bill higher than others?). [The second asset](https://github.com/HannahhoHe/Medicare---Insight-into-the-Bills/blob/master/README2.md) assesses whether a higher bill is attributed to a better service (see 2nd asset: Are the higher bills associated with quality services?). [See the codings](https://github.com/HannahhoHe/Medicare---Insight-into-the-Bills/blob/master/CROLChallenges_Section1.ipynb).
